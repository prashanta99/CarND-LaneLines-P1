**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 2 parts with substeps. 
To explain the steps I am taking below example image.

Part1. Create a Masked image with detected edges and Region of Interest:
   1. Converted Image to gray scale and apply Gaussian filter with KERNEL size = 3

   2. Identified edges using Canny edge detector

   3. Narrowed the detection area using Region of Interest

Part2. In this part our goal is to highlight the detected edges. This is done using hough Transform and 
       which results in a set of lines for both left and right lane.
       To get only one line I took average of the left and right lines and used it to Draw on the image
   1. Applied hough transform to the masked image resulted from step-3

   2. Take average of the lines and Draw those lines on the original image. This is done by merging the two images and applying weights. Below image is the finale result

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

This is very basic Lane detection algorithm confined to work on limited images. It may not work well especially on
curved or steep curved images. The Algorithm also lacks exact identification of the left and right lanes starting point.
I took the bottom end points as starting points. This may not work well in all cases and may end up detecting shoulder lines.
Also this algorith faces limitation of illumination for eg. it may not work well on different shades of day and night.


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A more matured and mathematical algorithm is needed where we take into account HSV for better color detection (different color lanes) histograms for identifying starting points for the left and right lanes and many other stable and advanced techniques.
